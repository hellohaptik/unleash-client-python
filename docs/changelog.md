## Next version

# Dummy Change
## v3.5.0
* (Major) Stop using the `default_value` argument in the `is_enabled()` method (as it can cause counter-intuitive behavior) and add deprecation warning.  This argument will be removed in the next major version upgrade!  
    * We recommend using the `fallback_function` argument instead.  If you need a blanket True in case of an exception, you can pass in a lambda like: `lambda x, y: True`. 
* (Minor) Add better logging for API errors.
* (Minor) Update requests version to v2.25.0.
